## Intro

Our stakeholders want to get a comprehensive dataset of all beauty and wellness salons in Austin, TX.

The dataset will be refreshed every month.

This repository contains a very simple outline of what needs to be built.

Here are 2 booking systems with examples of beauty and wellness salons in Austin, TX:

1. Vagaro

## Goals

1. Come up with a sane code architecture that will allow accomodating all future scrapers we will build.
2. Build a PoC for a couple systems.
3. Estimate and plan the next steps.

## Instructions

1. Build as much as you can in 2-3 hours.
2. Once you're done, write a succint report on what's left to do and how long it will take.
3. You're allowed to scrape non-Austin salons.
